- Extracted product ratings.
- Captured review titles/headers.
- Collected full review comments.
- Produced analysis-ready, clean, and structured data.

### Skills Strengthened
- Python web automation
- BeautifulSoup HTML parsing
- Dynamic website navigation
- Data cleaning for analytics

### Sample Python Code

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = 'https://www.flipkart.com/search?q=tv'
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)",
    "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.9"
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

for review in soup.find_all('div', {'class':'_27M-vq'}):
    name = review.find('p', {'class':'_2sc7ZR'}).text
    rating = review.find('div', {'class':'_3LWZlK'}).text
    title = review.find('p', {'class':'_2-N8zT'}).text
    comment = review.find('div', {'class': 't-ZTKy'}).text
    print(f"Reviewer: {name}\nRating: {rating}\nTitle: {title}\nComment: {comment}\n---")
```
This sample demonstrates sending a request with appropriate headers, parsing HTML, and extracting reviewer, rating, title, and comment information.[4][1]

| Alok G.    |   3    | Decent         | Good but sound could be better|
| Sneha P.   |   5    | Amazing        | Excellent viewing experience.|
| Rahul S.   |   4    | Satisfactory   | TV is superb, delivery was late.|
